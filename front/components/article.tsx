            Formula 1 team Oracle Red Bull Racing announces a multi-year
            partnership with the Layer 1 blockchain Sui.
            <br />
            <br /> The British company Oracle Red Bull Racing announced on
            Thursday that the Sui blockchain is now the official blockchain
            partner of the Formula 1 team.
            <br />
            <br /> Oracle Red Bull Racing was one of the first to adopt
            blockchain technology in Formula 1, recognizing its potential to
            connect fans around the world with the team in a truly unique and
            cutting-edge way.

          &quot;The alliance with Sui will enhance this experience, making
          access easier, safer, and more engaging,&quot; commented Christian
          Horner, Team Principal of Oracle Red Bull Racing. Developed by Mysten
          Labs and often presented as a rival to Aptos because it is based on
          the same programming language, the Sui blockchain made its debut last
          month.
          <br />
          <br />
          Oracle Red Bull Racing stated that it conducted an in-depth market
          study to select the network that would allow fans to &quot;engage in
          new ways.&quot; Like Ethereum, Sui enables the launch of decentralized
          applications.
          <br />
          <br /> &quot;Through this partnership, we can demonstrate the true
          power of blockchain technology, to create communities around new and
          groundbreaking connected experiences,&quot; said Evan Cheng,
          co-founder of Mysten Labs.
          <br />
          <br /> This is not the first time Red Bull Racing, which won the
          Monaco Grand Prix this weekend, has partnered with a player in the
          crypto ecosystem. Last year, the team made the exchange Bybit its
          second sponsor behind Oracle.
