            Layer 1 blockchain Sui, created by the team that led Meta&apos;s
            Diem crypto project, climbed into the top 10 decentralized finance
            (DeFi) rankings Tuesday, less than a year after inception, the
            project said.
            <br /> The total value locked (TVL) has jumped by more than 1,000%
            in four months, catapulting the blockchain above more established
            incumbents such as Bitcoin and Cardano, as well as Coinbase&apos;s
            layer-2, Base. The dollar value of cryptocurrencies deposited in its
            decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols topped $430 million, making
            it the 10th-largest blockchain by TVL, Sui said. As of writing, it
            had slipped to No. 11, behind PulseChain, DeFi Llama data show.

          Sui&apos;s mainnet went live in May 2023. It&apos;s a layer-1
          blockchain, much like Ethereum or Bitcoin, but with a specific type of
          proof-of-stake consensus named delegated proof-of-stake. Its native
          token, (SUI), is used for validator and delegator staking, to pay gas
          fees and as a right on governance.
          <br />
          <br /> According to DeFi Llama, at press time, Sui was home to 22 DeFi
          protocols, two of which had a TVL of over $100 million and four
          protocols with more than $40 million each.
          <br />
          <br /> The SUI price surged 109% in January, extending the two-month
          winning streak to hit a record-high $1.65, according to CoinDesk data.
          <br />
          <br /> Early this week, Sui announced integration with
          crypto-compatible payments infrastructure provider Banxa to add
          seamless and low-cost fiat on-ramps. Additionally, Mysten Labs&apos;
          Sui Wallet will facilitate the purchase of SUI tokens through Banxaâ€™s
          fiat on-ramp solution and utilize off-ramp solutions.
