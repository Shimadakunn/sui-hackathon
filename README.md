## What is it?

SuiPaper is a newspaper that provides access to quality articles about the Sui ecosystem through staking rather than a traditional subscription model. It creates a win-win-win situation:

- **For Users**: Can withdraw their stake at any time, avoiding financial loss compared to a subscription-based model.
- **For Article Writers**: Can earn money by writing quality articles about news on the Sui blockchain.
- **For Sui Blockchain**: Security is reinforced by staking, while quality content about the ecosystem is generated.

## How does it work?

On our platform, users connect and stake Sui tokens to our liquidity pool. In return, they receive **$FARM** tokens representing their position in the pool. The liquidity is then used to secure the Sui blockchain by deploying validator nodes. The profits generated are distributed among article writers to incentivize quality content.

## Additional Features

- Users can mint evolving NFTs throughout their journey, representing their status as dedicated readers.
- Writers can earn badges reflecting the quality of their articles.
- Our liquidity token ($FARM) is used to provide rewards proportional to the staking duration.
- $FARM can also be used to reward the most active community members through airdrops.
